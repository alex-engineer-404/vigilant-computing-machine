Vigilant File System Monitor with Sound Alerts
This Python script acts as a "vigilant computing machine" that monitors a specified directory for file system changes, specifically focusing on the creation, deletion, and movement/renaming of files and directories. When a new file is created or a file/directory is moved/renamed, it plays an audible alert sound, providing real-time notification of activity in the monitored location.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously watches a designated directory for changes.

New File Detection: Alerts when new files are created.

Movement/Rename Detection: Alerts when files or directories are moved or renamed.

Audible Alerts: Plays a distinct sound when a monitored event occurs.

Customizable: Easily configure the monitored directory, sound properties (duration, frequency, volume), and event types to monitor.

Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need the following Python libraries:

watchdog: For monitoring file system events.

numpy: For numerical operations, specifically for generating audio waves.

simpleaudio: For playing the generated audio waves.

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install watchdog numpy simpleaudio

Setup and Configuration
Save the Script:
Save the provided Python code as a .py file (e.g., vigilant_monitor.py).

Specify the Directory to Monitor:
Open the vigilant_monitor.py file in a text editor. Locate the following line under the --- Configuration --- section:

DIRECTORY_TO_MONITOR = "YOUR_DIRECTORY_TO_MONITOR"

Replace "YOUR_DIRECTORY_TO_MONITOR" with the absolute path of the directory you wish to monitor.

Example for Windows:

DIRECTORY_TO_MONITOR = r"C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\MyMonitoredFolder"

(The r prefix creates a raw string, which is useful for paths with backslashes.)

Example for Linux/macOS:

DIRECTORY_TO_MONITOR = "/home/youruser/Documents/MyMonitoredFolder"

Important: Ensure the specified directory exists on your system. The script will raise an error if the path is invalid.

Adjust Sound Settings (Optional):
You can customize the alert sound by modifying these variables in the --- Configuration --- section:

SOUND_DURATION: Length of the alert sound in seconds (default: 0.2).

SAMPLE_RATE: Audio sample rate in Hz (default: 44100).

ALERT_FREQUENCY: The frequency of the sine wave for the alert sound in Hz (default: 660). Higher values mean a higher pitch.

VOLUME: The volume level of the sound, from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (maximum) (default: 0.8).

Usage
Run the Script:
Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you saved vigilant_monitor.py and run the script using Python:

python vigilant_monitor.py

Monitor Activity:
The script will print a message indicating that it has started monitoring the specified directory. It will also recursively monitor any subdirectories within it.

Triggering Alerts:

Create a new file (e.g., a text document, an image, etc.) inside the monitored directory or any of its subdirectories.

Move or rename a file or directory within the monitored path.

Each time a new file is created or a file/directory is moved/renamed, a message will be printed to the console, and an alert sound will be played.

Stopping the Machine
To stop the vigilant machine, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the script is running. The script will catch the KeyboardInterrupt and shut down gracefully.

Customization and Extensions
Monitor other events: The MyEventHandler class includes placeholders for on_deleted and on_modified. You can uncomment and modify these sections to play sounds or perform other actions when files are deleted or modified.

Logging: Instead of just printing to the console, you could integrate a logging system to save events to a file.

Different Sounds: Implement more complex sound effects or use pre-recorded audio files instead of simple sine waves.

Notifications: Integrate with desktop notification systems (e.g., plyer for cross-platform notifications) to pop up alerts.

Web Interface: For advanced use cases, you could build a simple web interface to control the monitoring and view events.
